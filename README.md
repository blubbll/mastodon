# custom nodejs mastodon-scripts

- masto-count is a simple script that counts the actual registered (and unconfirmed too) accounts on a mastodon instance.
Best to be used with disconnected instances as they don't have any id holes.
Requires config-object mastoCount{} with mastoCount.host and mastoCount.interval
